<h3>1.sortIncreasing(int [] array)</h3>
This method accepts an array of integers as parameter,sort and sort it in acsending order.<br>The method is static which means that you can use it directly with the refrence of class.<br>The mehod itself do not return anything means it ha a void return type.But it will sort the array given to it in ascending order.
<h3>2.calcuteStats(int [] array)</h3>
This method accepts an array of integers as parameter<br>Extracts the maximum value,minimum value and average of the entries of the given array<br>The method is static which means that you can use it directly with the refrence of class.<br>The mehod itself returns a double type array whose (0)index consist the maximum value of the entire given array,(1)index consist the minimum value of the entire given array,(2)index consist of the average of the entire given array.
<h3>3.matrixAddition(int [] M2,int [][] M1,int rows,int columns)<h3>
This method take two 2-D arrays,int rows(rows of both the arrays),int columns(columns of both the arrays).
This bmethod retuns a 2-D array which consist of the sum of both given arrays as::The (0)index of this array consists the sum of (0)indx of M1 and (0)index of M2.
The method is static which means that you can use it directly with the refrence of class.
<h2>Note:The row and columns must be same for the both arrays which will be givan as arguments.It is recommended that you should implement this method while catching NullPointerException,as user can accidently given arrays of different orders</h2>
